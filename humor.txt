"A good laugh overcomes more difficulties and dissipates more dark clouds than any other one thing." 
"There is nothing like a gleam of humor to reassure you that a fellow human being is ticking inside a strange face."
"A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life."
